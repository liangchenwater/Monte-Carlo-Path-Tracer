# Monte-Carlo-Path-Tracer
A toy Monte Carlo path tracer

0. This is my final project for graduate level advanced CG course.
1. The repository contains a technical report on the state-of-art Gradient-Domain Rendering, and a toy monte carlo path tracer, including its source code, macOS executable file, Xcode project, and document.
2.ReportOnPathTracer.pdf is the document for my path tracer, and TechicalReportOnGDR.pdf is the report on GDR.
3. Rendering results are under output directory. The following naming rule is followed:
	scene_model_spp.tga
	e.g. cornell_cook_1.tga means 1spp cornell box scene with cook-torrance appearance model.
